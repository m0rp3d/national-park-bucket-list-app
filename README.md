National Park Bucket List App

This fullstack web app uses the Angular framework on the frontend and the Spring Boot framework on the backend. Using this app a user can login or create an account where they can click on a list of national parks to get information about a specific park. Each user has a checklist of national parks to click on to change the visited or not visited status of that park.

On the backend different microservices are used to perform different functions for the app. The MySql database is used to hold a list of national parks which contain important information about those parks. Using docker desktop and the MongoDB database, user accounts are stored for logging and registering. So that each user can have their own check list of visited national parks, Oracle database is used to hold the national park checklist for all users. Angular validation is used to ensure that proper formats are used for creating accounts.

Below is a video demo of that this app can do.
